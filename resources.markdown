This page hopes to serve as a repository of useful linkes to not only get you set up in whatever environment you might want to learn, but also any interesting tutorials, articles, etc...people might want to share.

It is the original authors hope that people continuously add to this page, but with some sort of method of grouping articles by similar topic.  If the existing topics don't fit your need, please feel free to add more topics.

Please, in an effort to keep page integrity for users, please make all links open in a new tab / window using {:target="_blank"} after the closing ] on your markdown links.

## GitHub - Version Control - Useful for all languages

* [Quick Intro to Github](http://try.github.io){:target="_blank"}
* [Github Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/){:target="_blank"}  
This page has links for all the basics that will help you install Github on your computer, set up SSH key's if desired, and walk you through the basics of forking and/or cloning repositories.
* [Advanced Github](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"}  
This page includes a variety of information including all the content of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){:target="_blank"} for free.  It runs for $56.99 on Amazon.com.

## General Programming Tutorials - Language Independent

* [Object-Oriented Design Tutorial](www.lynda.com/Java-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Object-Oriented-Design/96949-2.html){:target="_blank"}  
This is one of the better Lynda.com courses the initial contributor to this page has ever used.  Lynda.com is a subscription based service, but does allow for a 7 day free trial.  The course itself is 3 hours worth of video so could be completed in that time.  Course discusses the general principles of Object-Oriented Design without focusing on a specific language.  Helpful for learning the terminology and setup of Object-Oriented Design so that going into any language you will have a core of terms like *Class, Object, Inheritance, Abstraction, etc...*

## Websites (free and not free) that cover a variety of topics
(Requires searching and availability of specific languages/courses may vary)

* [Codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com){:target="_blank"}
* [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com){:target="_blank"}
* [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com){:target="_blank"}
* [Tustplus](http://www.tutsplus.com){:target="_blank"}
* [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com){:target="_blank"}
* [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org){:target="_blank"}

## Setting up a Mac (Non program Specific)

* [Homebrew Homepage](http://brew.sh){:target="_blank"}  
The tagline is ***the missing package manager for OS X***.  If you have a mac, and want to work on it using most languages, you'll want to use this to get the proper information installed.  Manages dependencies, tracks updates, and most of the most popular open source lanaguages/framerworks have distributions through homebrew to ease installation.

## Ruby & Rails Setup / Management

* Installing and Managing Ruby Versions 
  * [RVM](http://rvm.io){:target="_blank"}
  * [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv){:target="_blank"}
  * [Windows installation](http://rubyinstaller.org/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ruby Gem basics](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ruby Toolbox](http://ruby-toolbox.com){:target="_blank"}  
Allows you to look at, and search for, rubygems by functionality even if you don't know the name.  Also, given a specific category will list gems in order of popularity.  Other information (like most recent update for instance) aren't as reliable in the experience of the original author, so always double check that stuff.
* [Installing Ruby on Rails](http://installrails.com/steps/choose_os){:target="_blank"}  
This covers OS X, Windows, Linux.  On OS X and Linux, this isn't really that complicated if you've set up the issues above.  Just type `gem install rails` and Ruby on Rails and dependencies are installed automatically.  Though original author has no experience with Windows installation, he has heard that it can be difficult.


## Ruby & Rails Tutorials

* [General Introduction to Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html){:target="_blank"}  
A very brief introduction to the basics of Rails.  A good thing to run through to get a quick look at how fast, and easy, Rails can allow you to build things.  Rails Guides in general are a great place to start as they have articles regarding the core functions of Rails that all should use, however, not as indepth as most tutorials.
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/){:target="_blank"}  
The 'hardway' series is a free step by step tutorial that will delve into the basics of learning the Ruby language, which is also helpful to write your own Ruby on Rails code going forward.
* Programming Books (not free)
  * [The Well Grounded Rubyist](https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-second-edition){:target="_blank"}
  * [Learning to Program](https://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program){:target="_blank"}
  * [Rails 4 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action){:target="_blank"}
  * [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](https://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4){:target="_blank"}
* Interactive Web Tutorials (not free)
  * [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/){:target="_blank"}  
  The 'grandaddy' of the ruby on rails tutorials, by Michael Hartl (often referred to as the Hartl Tutorial).  Taking a test driven development process you will build a twitter clone, from scratch, eschewing certain gems (like Devise for instance) in favor of building your own functionality from scratch.
  * [Railscasts](http://www.railscasts.com){:target="_blank"}  
  Though inactive for a few years now, still a plethora of good videos on specific topics.  Some free, some not free, videos, though access to the not free videos is a nominal amount ($9 once) as the creator seems unlikely to come back anytime soon.

## Bootcamps

* [Switchup.org](https://www.switchup.org/){:target="_blank"}  
  A good place to get information on the variety of bootcamps, both online and physical, available.
