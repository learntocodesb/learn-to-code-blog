# Learn to Code -- Santa Barbara

## About
This is a site and blog for the Learn to Code -- Santa Barbara meetup group.

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

## Prerequisites
First, I would recommend having a ruby environment tool like `rbenv` or `rvm` installed. Second, I would check out Jekyll's [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) guide to get some baseline familiarity with the site's structure.

## Getting Set Up
Getting setup is as simple as having `ruby-2.3.0` and running `bundle install` from the command line.

From there, you can:
1. `rake posts:generate title=title-of-awesome-post` to generate a new post.
2. `rake assets:precompile` to compile the site.
3. run either `heroku local` (if you have the [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)) or just `jekyll serve` and navigate your browser to see your awesome new post.

## Contributing
Contributing comes in many forms. You can:
* Submit issues or ideas.
* Make some sweet sass-y styling changes (or help make this site more original and unique to our group).
* Write new blog posts about anything programming, design or tech related.
* Anything else that you can thing of!

Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request from your fork :)
